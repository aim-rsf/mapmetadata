Description: Prior to gaining full access to health datasets, explore
    publicly available metadata and map metadata onto predefined research
    domains.  This package uses structural metadata files downloaded from
    the Health Data Research Gateway (https://healthdatagateway.org/en).
    In theory, any metadata file with the same structure as the files
    downloaded from this gateway can be used with this package, but the
    package has been developed and tested on metadata files from this
    gateway only.
